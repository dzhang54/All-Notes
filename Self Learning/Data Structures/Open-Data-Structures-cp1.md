## 1.1 - The Need for Efficiency  
Data structure are very important and we interact with them constantly:  
 > Open a file: locating and opening file  
 > Looking up a contact on your phone: access contacts quickly and accurately  
     
**Efficiency**
  > Number of operations: Application with 10^6 items, so if we expect to do 1 million searches, this leads to 10^12 inspections  
  > Processor speeds: It will take 10^12/10^9 = 1000 seconds to run the application  
  > Bigger data sets: Google has 8.5 billion web pages, they receive 4500 queries per second, so they need 38,250 servers just to keep up  
  > The solution: efficient way to store the data
